        <h1>Questions - Part 1</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</strong></li>
            <p>Years ago I saw a couple of videos about HTML. During that time my English was not the best, so I was not abled to understand. I remember knowing the elements that a basic HTML document needs it like DOCTYPE, html, head, and body, but nothing more. I had 0 knowledge of CSS and, of course no clue about JavaScript.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</strong> </li>
            <p>For my Final Project, I decided to build my portafolio from scratch, to challenge myself. </p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</strong></li>
            <p>I would said that there was several things that challenge me; the first one is the use of divs and how to display the content in the way I wanted. I had to deal with this in the artifacts section and in the section when I put all the validation images. w3school was really helpful for this part. Adapting the website to the size of the user screen was another big challenge, I work with a 27" monitor and everything was looking ok until I open the link in my phone. A lot of reading to understand this challenge and a lot inspect.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </strong></li>
            <p>Respect to all the software engineers! I have to say that it is really difficult especially JavaScript, I don't feel confident about my knoweledge of this programming language. I thought that it will be something that I could memorize like CSS, but you have to do a lot of logic thinking.This class also make me see the websites that I usually visit differently, now I know all the work that is behind, and with my little knowelege when a website looks outdated, I think in ways to improve it. </p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</strong></li>
            <p>Try to complete your homeworks on time, and have at least one day to focus in this class. I think practice helps a lot to understand the concepts. Also if you feel that you are not understandin what are you reading, check Youtube and of course w3school.</p>
