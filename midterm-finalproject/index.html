        <h2>Welcome to my Website</h2>
        <p class="welcomeText">I have been creating this portfolio throughout this Winter quarter 2023.  I truly believe that this is the sample of the knowledge that I acquired during the course.</p>

        <p class="welcomeText">In this portafolio I chose to represent a little bit of my culture, using a colorful background image. In the first section of each page, you will find a title that will help you to know were you are. Also in each page you have a navigation bar, this menu contains a link to the 6 pages of the project.</p>

        <p class="welcomeText">The first icon that appears in the navigation bar represents the "Home" site, the one that you are currently reading. The next title that you will see is "About" in this site you will read a little bit of me, the owner of this website. The third title is "Coursework", in this site you will read about the courses that I've been taken throughout the years in the Bellevue College. The next site is "Artifacts" you will be able to see the five artifacts that I developed in this course, ,y favorite one is the number 5, I share some pictures of the landscapes that I've seen during my roadtrips.</p>
    
        <p class="welcomeText">The next title in the navigation bar is, "Module Assignments", in this site you will see a list of all the completed assignments; you will discover that the first modules are build by using just HTML, you will realize that little by little the assigments were more complex. The last modules are build with a combination of HTML, CSS AND JavaScript. Then in the "Contact Me" title you will find a form to contact me! The next title is "Own" in this site you I am sharing one of the interests that I acquired during  the pandemic, which is  "Salt Water Tanks." I will share you some of the process that my husband and I did to set the tank and some videos of how we started and how we are now. Our prioty is to keep them happy and healthy, always asking to the experts to guarantee that all the live beings are going to be fine, living togheter. Last but not least in the check icon, you will find the prove that all my pages passed the CSS validation and the HTML validation.</p>
