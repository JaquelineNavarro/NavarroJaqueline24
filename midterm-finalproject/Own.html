        <h3 class="ownTitle">The Experience of Having a Salt Walter Tank at Home</h3>
        <p class="ownP">In an impulse to keep us busy during the pandemic, we went to the closest Pet Smart and we bought a tank. With the tank at home we started to discuss the idea of having a salt water tank or a freshwater tank. We started to read about them, we also saw a ton of Youtube videos and we decided that we wanted a salt water one. A little parenthesis, I though that having a tank at home was easy just adding water from the tap and putting the fishes and voila.</p>
        <p class="ownP">We made a list of the things that we needed for the first phase, we bought sand, a filter to make our own water at home, a bucket of salt, circulation pumps, and canister filter during our first visit to the pet store. A life-saving advice: always check that your filter has the rubber gasket. We didn't pay attention to that tiny detail, and after filling our tank with the water already mixed with the salt, the horror happened. When we were setting the filter, we flooded our apartment! it was 1 am in the morning luckily there was a drain on the balcony. After that unfortunate event we went to return the filter and they we us a new one. When we were at the store we double check that the filter was complete. We set the filter, we filled the tank with the water and we add the ammonia.</p>
        <p>Yes ammonia! it is weird i KNOW</p>
