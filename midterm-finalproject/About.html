        <p class="aboutme">My name is <b>Jaqueline Monserrath Navarro Pedraza</b> (I know it is a pretty long name). I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colima" target="_blank">Colima</a> a small state in Mexico, which is also know as the "City of the Palm Trees." I move to the PNW area more than five years ago, and I love this place! Don't get me wrong I still love my natal Colima. </p>
        <p class="aboutme">In my country I studied in the University of Colima, I have a bachelors degree in International Business. After my graduation I worked in a Custom, in the border between Chihuahua, Mexico and Presidio, Texas. It was a pretty tiny town named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojinaga_Municipality" target="_blank">Ojinaga. </a>During winters it was really cool and in summer extremely hot. It was a really interesting job, but due security reasons I decided to quit and move to the City of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalajara" target="_blank">Guadalajara. </a>In Guadalajara I worked for a Company Name ASC American Sun Components, I was in the sales and buys area.</p>
        <h2>What I do?</h2>
        <p class="aboutme"> Currently, I am a full-time student in Bellevue College. I started as a part of the ESL program a few years back, and with the help of my instructors and navigators I found a patwhay to follow here in the Bellevue College. Of course I am a home makert too, luckly my husband and I work as a team so I have plenty of time to accomplish and submit the assigments on time.</p>
        <h2>My Goals!</h2>
        <p class="aboutme">One of my main goals is finish the Software Development AAS-T program. Another goal that I would love to achieve is do an intership in a Company like Google (I saw the movie "The Intership", that is why Google is in my mind). Another goal that I have is improve my English, specially my speaking. I don't want to struggle in communication with my future coworkers.</p>
